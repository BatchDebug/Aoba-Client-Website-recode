# About Aoba
Aoba started as a small project back when I was in highschool. It started as a standalone modified Minecraft jar, first appearing on September 16th 2020, that had to be compiled on the user's computer to be used (due to the Minecraft EULA prohibitting distributing modified jars!). During that period, Aoba had received little to no updates due to the creator focusing on University at the time. 

Nowadays, Aoba has been ported to Fabric and is actively maintained by the original creator.
