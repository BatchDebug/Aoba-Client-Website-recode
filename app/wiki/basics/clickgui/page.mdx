# ClickGUI
The ClickGUI is an essential part of Aoba. From the ClickGUI, almost every function of Aoba can be performed.

The ClickGUI has 3 different navigation 'pages', all displaying a different grouping of content.
These three pages are labeled, Modules, Tools, and HUD respectively.

# Navigation Bar
Detail below are the 3 pages and what content they contains:

## Modules
This page contains all of the modules and their settings.
In this page, you are able to toggle modules, and edit their settings.

## Tools
Currently this page does not contain much, but the intention is to create a central location for any GUI related tools.
An example of a current 'tool' is the AuthCracker for offline servers, which allows you to break into a cracked account's
auth code using a set of commonly used passwords. Future planned Tools include a Baritone API tool.

## HUD
This page contains the ability to enable and disable certain HUD elements on the screen.
These HUD elements, once enabled, will stay on the user's screen even while they have the
ClickGUI closed. HUD elements can be moved around by clicking and dragging them around like
a window.
