# Commands
Commands are similar to Modules, but are interacted with through the ingame chat.

A command in Aoba is prefixed with **.aoba**, followed by 'parameters'. An example of a command is **.aoba fly speed 10**.

Almost every Module has an accompanying command for setting variables such as speed, radius, etc...
